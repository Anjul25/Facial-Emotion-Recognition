# Facial-Emotion-Recognition


The Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) system is the process of identifying the emotional state of a person. In general, facial gestures are normal and clear means of expressing their feelings and intentions to human beings. The main features of non-verbal conversations are facial expressions. Automatic facial expression recognition systems have many applications including, but not limited to, human behavior understanding, and detection of mental disorders. In this project, various deep learning methods have been used to identify the seven key human emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality.
 
In this project, facial  emotion  recognition  systems are  implemented  using  Convolution  Neural  Network (CNN) and Transfer Learning using VGG16 models with various capacities. Facial emotion dataset from Kaggle along with a few images taken by us are included to train the models. The training dataset has 28,709, and the testing dataset has 7,179 images.
